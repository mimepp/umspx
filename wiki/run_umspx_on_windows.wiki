== Install ==
 * since umspx is based on xampp which is a "Apache + PHP" package, there will be a full package and script_only package for umspx
  * full package includes the script_only
  * full = xampp + umspx_script_only
  * if version of script_only is large, you need to use the latest one.
 * download umspx full package:
  * e.g.: umspx_vx.x_full.7z 
  * http://code.google.com/p/umspx/downloads/list
 * uncompressed it to c:\
 * you should get c:\umspx
 * download latest script_only package:
  * e.g.: umspx_vx.x_script_only.zip 
  * if the version of script_only is the same as version of full usmpx, you do not need to download the script_only package.
 * unzip it to c:\, it will over write files in the c:\umspx

== How to start umsp ==
 * 1. double-click on setup_xampp.bat
  * if you fail to run this command, please install VC9 run time library:
   * http://code.google.com/p/umspx/wiki/VC9_run_time_library
  * you need run it only once, when you want to run umsp again after a reboot, just go to step 2;
 * 2. double-click on apache_start.bat
 * 3. change the IP address in umsp_start.bat to your PC's address.
 * 4. double-click on run umsp_start.bat
 * 5. If you could not see umspx on your upnp server list, please close your "windows firewall"

== What's the port of umspx ==
 * default port is 7703.

== How umsp works ==
 * 1. ssdp
  * it will use wget to request the ssdp php page
  * e.g.:
   * wget.exe http://192.168.1.3:7703/umsp/send-ssdp.php?btnSend=Submit -O - -q
 * 2. sleep
  * then sleep for 5 seconds by using ping command.
  * you could change this timeout to a long value you want if you do not want it send ssdp too fast
